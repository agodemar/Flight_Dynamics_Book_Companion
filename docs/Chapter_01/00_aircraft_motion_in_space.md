## Euler angles

Aircraft orientation in space is typically modeled using three angles: heading, elevation, and roll. This is also known as Euler angles. 

- **Heading** $\psi$ is the angle between the aircraft's longitudinal axis (front to back) and the North, measured in the horizontal plane. It represents the aircraft's left or right direction.
- **Elevation** $\theta$ is the angle between the aircraft's longitudinal axis and the horizontal plane. It represents the aircraft's up or down direction.
- **Roll** $\phi$ is the rotation around the aircraft's longitudinal axis. It represents the aircraft's tilt to the left or right.

These angles are used to define the aircraft's orientation in a 3D space. They are crucial for navigation, control systems, and flight dynamics. 

In addition to Euler angles, there are other methods to represent orientation such as quaternions and direction cosine matrices. These methods can help to avoid certain issues like gimbal lock that can occur with Euler angles. 

It's important to note that the modeling of aircraft orientation is a complex topic that involves various aspects of physics, mathematics, and engineering.
