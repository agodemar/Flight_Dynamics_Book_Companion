# Introduction to the Flight Dynamics Book companion website

Welcome to the companion website for the Flight Dynamics Book. Here, you'll find a collection of materials accumulated since 2011, with special recognition for the valuable contributions made by students enrolled in the Flight Dynamics and Simulation course at the University of Naples Federico II.

This website serves as an extension of the Flight Dynamics Book, providing additional resources, including complementary lecture notes, case studies, simulations, and multimedia content. The collaborative effort of students has played a significant role in shaping this platform, contributing their insights, projects, and research.

## Key Features

The key features of this website are the following:

1. **Comprehensive Resources:** Access a variety of materials that complement the concepts covered in the Flight Dynamics Book.

2. **Interactive Learning:** Engage with simulations, quizzes, and practical exercises to reinforce theoretical principles.

3. **Updates and Additions:** Stay informed about the latest content updates and additional chapters related to flight dynamics.

Whether you're studying aircraft dynamics or exploring the world of flight, this platform is here to support your learning journey. Feel free to explore the resources available and make the most of your educational experience.

## Technology

The content on this platform is made accessible through a transparent and collaborative approach. Utilizing the [GitHub](https://github.com) repository framework, we've implemented a user-friendly GitHub Pages website that hosts static content rendered via [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). This choice of technology ensures a seamless and easily navigable experience for users.

One notable feature is the integration of Jupyter notebooks into the website. Several pages are rendered from Jupyter notebooks, adding an interactive dimension to the learning materials. These notebooks are designed to run the [Jupyter MATLAB kernel](https://github.com/mathworks/jupyter-matlab-proxy), providing a practical and hands-on environment for users to engage with MATLAB-based content.

The use of GitHub and MkDocs not only facilitates the organization and version control of the content but also allows for contributions and feedback from a wider community. This collaborative environment reflects the shared efforts of students and contributors over the years.

By leveraging these technologies, we aim to provide a flexible and accessible learning experience. Whether you're exploring static content, engaging with Jupyter notebooks, or benefiting from MATLAB-based simulations, this platform is designed to cater to diverse learning preferences, ensuring that the study of flight dynamics remains an inclusive and enriching experience for all users.

## Navigate the website

Navigating through the material content on this website is a straightforward process, designed to provide you with easy access to the available resources. Simply use the menus and the table of contents to explore the content at your own pace.

* Menus: The navigation menus help you quickly find the sections you're interested in. Whether you're looking for complementary lecture notes, case studies, simulations, or other resources, the menus provide a convenient way to jump to specific categories.
