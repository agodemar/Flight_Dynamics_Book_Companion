# Introduction to the Flight Dynamics Book companion website

Welcome to the companion website for the Flight Dynamics Book!

Here, you'll find a collection of materials accumulated since 2011, primarily by the authors themselves. This website serves as an extension of the Flight Dynamics Book, providing additional resources, including complementary lecture notes, case studies, simulations, and multimedia content. The collaborative effort of students has played a significant role in shaping this platform. In fact, several exercises were revised with the help of numerous students who have actively participated in the Flight Dynamics and Simulation course at the University of Naples Federico II, contributing to the rich collection of resources available here.

## Key Features

The key features of this website are the following:

1. **Comprehensive Resources:** Access a variety of materials that complement the concepts covered in the Flight Dynamics Book.

2. **Interactive Learning:** Engage with simulations, quizzes, and practical exercises to reinforce theoretical principles.

3. **Updates and Additions:** Stay informed about the latest content updates and additional chapters related to flight dynamics.

Whether you're studying aircraft dynamics or exploring the world of flight, this platform is here to support your learning journey. Feel free to explore the resources available and make the most of your educational experience.

## Technology

The content on this platform is made accessible through a transparent and collaborative approach. Utilizing the [GitHub](https://github.com) repository framework, we've implemented a user-friendly [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website that hosts static content rendered via [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). This choice of technology ensures a seamless and easily navigable experience for users.

One notable feature is the integration of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) into the website. Several pages are rendered directly from Jupyter notebooks, adding an interactive dimension to the learning materials. These notebooks are designed to run the [Jupyter MATLAB kernel](https://github.com/mathworks/jupyter-matlab-proxy), providing a practical and hands-on environment for users to engage with MATLAB-based content.

The use of the above mentioned technologies facilitates the organization and version control of the content but also allows for contributions and feedback from a wider community. This collaborative environment reflects the shared efforts of the book authors and several other contributors over the years.

## Navigate the website

Navigating through the material content on this website is a straightforward process, designed to provide you with easy access to the available resources. Simply use the menus and the table of contents to explore the content at your own pace.

* Menus: The navigation menus help you quickly find the sections you're interested in. Whether you're looking for complementary lecture notes, case studies, simulations, or other resources, the menus provide a convenient way to jump to a specific subject. 

* Search: Feel free to use the search feature to look for keywords.

## Navigate the raw repository

All materials, including the content on this website, are sourced from a GitHub repository, accessible at the following address: [https://github.com/agodemar/Flight_Dynamics_Book_Companion](https://github.com/agodemar/Flight_Dynamics_Book_Companion). Within the repository's `docs` subfolder [available here](https://github.com/agodemar/Flight_Dynamics_Book_Companion/tree/main/docs), you'll find notebooks (`*.ipynb`), MATLAB M-files (`*.m`), data files (`*.mat`), Simulink models (`*.slx`), and various auxiliary files in different formats. The `docs` folder is organized into subdirectories corresponding to the chapters of the book, facilitating easy navigation according to the book's structure.
